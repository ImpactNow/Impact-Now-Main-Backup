Our driving passion is to partner with people of the nations of the world, give praise to Jesus and advance the Kingdom of God in a practical and supernatural way. We firmly believe that true religion in the sight of God the Father is to look after the poor, the widow, the orphan and the outcast. We are committed to bring God-honoring impact and transformation into the lives of people in our local and global communities with a message of hope, faith, reconciliation, and the compassion of Jesus Christ.</h5>
